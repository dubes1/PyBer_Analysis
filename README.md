# PyBer_Analysis  
## Overview of the Analysis  
Analyzing ride sharing app data to determine access and affordability for different geographic zone types  
## Results of the analysis  
* Rural rides have the lowest amount of drivers however they have the highest avg fare  
![fig 1](https://github.com/dubes1/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig1.png?raw=true)  
* Urban also has by far the highest percentage of drivers while rural has a very low share of total drivers

* Urban accounts for 68 percent of total rides but has over 80 % of total drivers

## Summary  
Based on these results I would suggest making a bigger push to get more rural drivers because they have a higher avg fare and the areas are underserved because they have close to 7% of total rides but only 2.6% of total drivers
